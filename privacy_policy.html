            <h2>Privacy Policies</h2>

            <p class="pt-5"><strong>ExploreOTC App Privacy Policy</strong></p>
            <p>Information and services offered on ExploreOTC are provided by Ozarks Technical Community College (OTC) Springfield, Missouri. The purpose of the app is to provide public information about the college and to offer online services to students, college faculty and staff. Online services include, but are not limited to, application registration, signing up for further contact from departments, and survey completion. OTC recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy rights of our users. Any private information, as defined by FERPA and all other applicable laws,  policies and guidelines shared between users and OTC is securely managed and safeguarded.</p>

            <p class="pt-4"><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong></p>
            <p>OTC may make adjustments to our privacy statement at any time because of changes in the law, in technology, in OTC’s business or in our attempts to serve your needs better. We will use every effort to communicate in a timely manner any changes to our privacy statement in the manner described in the OTC’s Website Policies and Disclaimers.</p>

            <p class="pt-4"><strong>What information does OTC gather?</strong></p>
            <p>When you first load the app it will ask for your full name, email address, and phone number. These are required to use the app. We do this so we can use this information for identification purposes in other parts of the app and possible further contact if you approve it, and this information is not shared with other organizations.</p>
            <p>If you choose to share personal information with us— by filling out an electronic form with personal information— we will use the information only for the purposes you authorized or in support of college sponsored programs. Some of the information may be saved for a designated period of time to comply with Missouri’s archiving policies, but we will not disclose the information to other third parties or government agencies, unless required to do so by state or federal law or in support of college sponsored programs. If we are required to disclose information about you by law, we will make every effort to notify you of the disclosure in advance.</p>

            <p class="pt-4"><strong>How the Information is Used</strong></p>
            <p>Information gathered through the ExploreOTC app is used to improve the apps experience for our prospective students.</p>

            <p class="pt-4"><strong>Directory Information</strong></p>
            <p>OTC designates certain personally identifiable information that is contained within the student’s education record as “directory information” so that the college may, at its discretion, disclose this information without a student’s prior written consent. This information is student name, home address, major field of study, academic classification (freshman/sophomore), part-time or full-time status, participation in recognized activities and photos, dates of attendance, degrees and certificates, matriculation and withdrawal dates, memberships in national honor societies, awards and honors and inclusion of an individual in a group photo. A student may restrict the publication and release of this directory information by filing a written request with the Office of the Registrar.
In addition, the following information is always considered releasable: previous dates of attendance, degrees and awards received and previous educational agencies or institutions attended. The complete policy regarding the collection, retention and dissemination of information about a student is available in the Office of the Registrar.</p>

            <p class="pt-4"><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong></p>
            <p>Our app may contain links to other public or private entities’ websites, whose privacy practices we do not control.</p>

            <p class="pt-4"><strong>Choice to Provide Information</strong></p>
            <p>There is no requirement for you to provide any information at our application. However, the services will not be available to you without registration.</p>

            <p class="pt-r"><strong>Visitor Comments or Review</strong></p>
            <p>If you have questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this website or if you choose to review or correct any information, please contact us at web@otc.edu, or call 417-447-7556.</p>
